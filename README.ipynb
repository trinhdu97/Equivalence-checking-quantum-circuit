    "# Scalable Equivalence Checking and Verification of Shallow Quantum Circuits – Artifact README\n",

    "\n",
    "This project has been developed and tested using the following software environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python Version\n",
    "- Python **3.13.2**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Required Libraries\n",
    "- `qiskit` (version **1.4.2**)\n",
    "- `qiskit-aer` (version **0.17.0**)\n",

    "## Important Notes on Hardware and Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Hardware Information**  \n",
    "   Hardware specifications used in our experiments are described in the paper. While actual runtimes will vary across systems, the **scaling trends with respect to the number of qubits and circuit depth** should remain consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Memory Constraints**  \n",
    "   The **maximum number of qubits** and **circuit depth** you can simulate will depend on your system’s RAM:\n",
    "   - For **statevector simulations**, memory usage grows exponentially with `n_qubits`. On our setup with 1TB of Memory, we were able to simulate up to **34 qubits**.\n",
    "   - For **local projection computation**, memory grows **linearly with qubit count** and **exponentially with depth**, allowing larger `n_qubits` in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "   > ⚠️ **Tip:** Qiskit will automatically raise a warning if a state vector simulation exceeds available resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Execution Strategy**  \n",
    "   Before running any notebook cell, please read the comments to understand:\n",
    "   - What each block computes\n",
    "   - Whether pre-computed results are already shown, and how we expect on the results\n",
    "   - How long the block may take to run\n",
    "\n",
    "   For blocks with **long runtime**, we recommend executing them via standalone Python scripts using a persistent session tool like `tmux`. These blocks are generally **independent** of each other (except for initial imports and core module loading). Then they can be cut out from the notebook to run easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Erratum**  \n",
    "   We acknowledge a typo in the paper (Line 879):  \n",
    "   - The correct range for `n` is: **20 ≤ n ≤ 34**, not **10 ≤ n ≤ 34**.  \n",
    "   - This will be corrected in the revised submission (due **July 29**).\n",
